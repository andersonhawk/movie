Once!
The difference between once and never is the whole world.
The difference between never and once is the difference between good and bad.

So how can that be the difference between good and bad?

Even no matter what the situation is, you can make it good, like with plaster and brick.
You never knew that because you never lifted a finger, you fucking lazy cunt.
But you know what? You can take a situation and you can draw a circle around it
and find a way to work something out. You don't just drive away from it.
No, or sit in the corner of some greasy little funcking pub somewhere
like you're the fucking happy little maverick.

You leave concrete behind you everywhere.

Okay? I made one mistake. I don't feel anything for this woman.
and I'm trying to do the right thing tonight, because she is on her own and the baby is my fault.
And I know how it feels to be coming out into the world like this.

I would really like it if you would say that you will wait and I can come back and
we can talk.. We can talk about it and that we can fix something up.
I really want to know that tomorrow I can drive home and talk to the boys and
be at home as normal, and we can go out or something and have a drink and talk about it.
I want to know that I am not driving in one direction
I want to know that I will be driving back when the sun comes up.

When I left the site just two hours ago, I had a job, a wife, a home.
And now I have none of those things. I have none of those things left.
I just have myself and the car that I'm in. And I'm just driving and that's it.

Ivan, you fucked up your life, that's your business, but Chicago is going insane.
Two words I learned tonight: Fuck Chicago.
