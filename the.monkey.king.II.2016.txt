五百年前你相信自己，大闹天宫，五百年后你还是没有变，
500 years ago, you trusted yourself, so you wreaked havoc in heaven, but now, you haven't changed in any way.
为何不放弃自己去相信别人， 一直以来，你用自己的错与对去看别人的对与错
why don't you trust others rather than yourself? You have always been judging others with your own standard
of right or wrong 
你火眼金睛看的是真相，但你师父看的是心相
What you Fiery Feyes see is truth, but what your master sees is heart
