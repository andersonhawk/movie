Why?
I don't know. I gues I needed something.

What did you need?
I need to feel alive.
I just wanted to do something outrageous. And it felt really good, to be needed. And to be trusted. And to be special.
It's just that there's... so much I wanted to do with this life...
and it's like I haven't done any of it. And the sand's running out of the hourglass...
and I wanted to be able to look back and say, "See? I did that! I was reckless and I was wild and I fucking did it!"
Quite flankly, I don't give a shit...Whether you understand that or not.
