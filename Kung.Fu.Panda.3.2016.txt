I have taken the Chi of every master here. And soon I will have your power too.

When will you realize, the more you take, the less you have.


If you only do what you can do you'll never be more than you are now.
I don't wanna be more. I like who I am.

Oogway saw greatness in you, Po, against my better judgement.
More than you can see in yourself.
Incredible power awaits you. Power beyond anything you can imagine.
