The rifle is the first weapon you learn how to use...
because it lets you keep your distance from the client
The closer you get to being a pro...
the closer  you can get to the client.
The knife, for example, is the last thing you learn.

Mathilda, since I met you, everything's been different.
So I just need some time alone. You need some time to grow up a little.

I finished growing up, Leon. I just get older.

For me it's the opposite. I'm old enough. I need time  to grow up.
