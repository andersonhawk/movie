Even if she hates you, you got to let her hate you,  so she can feel better about it, she can get better.
This ain't about how you feel. I mean, you got to let her go through her thing and
not think that thing is your thing. Then you can deal with life, like that stuff. boxing, whatever you want.


The way you fight ...anger's your biggest tool.
Fighting angry, that drains you twice as fast.
The other guy... in the ring is your enemy,
but if all you tring to do is kill him, then you expose yourself.
You leave yourself vulnerable. Got to protect yourself.
Make his mistakes... be his destruction.
Right now, you got two weapsons: a shotgun and a grenade. All power, no precision.
I want you to use your other arsenal. There you go, tap, tap, tap....
