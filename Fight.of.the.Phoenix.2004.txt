So why not try and build the plane?

Why give people false hope?

Come on, man. Most people spend their whole lives hanging on to hopes and dreams that are never gonna come true, but they hold on to them.
Why are you gonna give up on them now when you need them most?

You're assuming I'm one of those people who has hopes and dreams.

I find it hard to believe that a man who learns to fly never had a dream.

Look, how could I let those people build that plane when I don't believe it'll work?
And every day they waste trying to build it brings them one day closer to dying.

I think a man only needs one thing in life. He just needs someone to love. 
If You can't give him that, then give him something to hope for.
And if you can't give him that just give him something to do.

James, you'll never make it.
Then, I'll die trying. There are people counting on me.
